<h1 id="label-ActionCable+CLI">ActionCable CLI</h1>

<p>This is a tiny PoC that shows a Rails API-Only app, communicated with via CLI -&gt; ActionCable (WebSockets). It also has RedLock for distributed locking. This was based on [<a href="https://www.hansschnedlitz.com/2021/04/04/build-real-time-clis-with-actioncable.html">www.hansschnedlitz.com/2021/04/04/build-real-time-clis-with-actioncable.html</a>] with some changes like adding linters, rake tasks, and a few other boilerplate things.</p>

<h2 id="label-Options+used+to+generate+the+initial+Rails+app">Options used to generate the initial Rails app</h2>

<p>Here is the command-line used to generate the initial Rails app:</p>

<pre class="code ruby"><code class="ruby">rails new actioncable-cli \
    --api \
    --skip-action-mailer \
    --skip-action-mailbox \
    --skip-action-text \
    --skip-active-job \
    --skip-active-record \
    --skip-active-storage \
    --skip-javascript \
    --skip-jbuilder \
    --skip-spring \
    --skip-test \
    --skip-system-test \
    --skip-webpack-install \
    --skip-turbolinks
</code></pre>

<p>You’re probably going to want AR and other things if you were doing a real app.</p>

<h2 id="label-Why-3F">Why?</h2>

<p>Rails is a powerful framework with a huge community, but sometimes you don’t really want a WebApp. You just want the ORM, messaging, logging, etc. for your CLI app. You’ll get all of that, plus the benefits of WebSockets. WS brings a lot of message bus features to the table without needing to run an actual message bus like RabbitMQ or ActiveMQ.</p>

<p>AND, this architecture will allow your CLI to scale prittay, prittay, prittay, prittayyyy well.</p>

<h2 id="label-Pre-Requisites">Pre-Requisites</h2>

<p>Redis Server either running on localhost:6379 OR you can export REDIS_URL in the environment to use whatever. Don’t clobber something important in an important Redis box!</p>

<p>Probably want RVM working, I put this together on Ruby 3.2.0.</p>

<h2 id="label-To+Setup">To Setup</h2>

<p>bundle install</p>

<h2 id="label-To+Run">To Run</h2>

<h3 id="label-Backend">Backend</h3>

<h4 id="label-Use+the+run-backend+script">Use the run-backend script</h4>

<p>Use the bin/run-backend script to start Rails and Sidekiq in a terminal window. This script will exit if you hit any key or ctrl-c it. This is the easy way.</p>

<h4 id="label-The+script+doesn-27t+work+how+can+I+run+it+manually-3F">The script doesn’t work how can I run it manually?</h4>

<p>Alternatively to run the backend manually:</p>

<p>Start Rails and Sidekiq (you will need two terminals unless you put them in the background):</p>

<pre class="code ruby"><code class="ruby"><span class='id identifier rubyid_bundle'>bundle</span> <span class='id identifier rubyid_exec'>exec</span> <span class='id identifier rubyid_rails'>rails</span> <span class='id identifier rubyid_server'>server</span>
  <span class='id identifier rubyid_bundle'>bundle</span> <span class='id identifier rubyid_exec'>exec</span> <span class='id identifier rubyid_sidekiq'>sidekiq</span>
</code></pre>

<h3 id="label-CLI">CLI</h3>

<p>The CLI in this case is just a simple Thor task for demonstration purposes. In real life you’d probably have a small script in bin to load Thor and use it more like a traditional CLI. There is nothing stopping you from using another CLI framework though.</p>

<pre class="code ruby"><code class="ruby"><span class='id identifier rubyid_bundle'>bundle</span> <span class='id identifier rubyid_exec'>exec</span> <span class='id identifier rubyid_thor'>thor</span> <span class='label'>worker:</span><span class='id identifier rubyid_start'>start</span>
</code></pre>

<p>You will see a worker executes on the backend and streams its progress back to your client (the thor task).</p>

<h2 id="label-How+Does+this+Work-3F">How Does this Work?</h2>

<h3 id="label-1.+Thor+task+connects+to+Rails-27+WebSocket+Server+-28ActionCable-29">1. Thor task connects to Rails’ WebSocket Server (ActionCable)</h3>

<p>The thor worker:start task (located in lib/tasks/worker.thor), connects to Rails’ websocket server running on localhost:3000, and it does so asynchronously. It connects to the route /cable, which is the the default ActionCable route, and it passes a “client_id” parameter to the /cable route.</p>

<p>These parameters are processed in app/channels/application_cable/connection.rb</p>

<p>In there, the ‘connect’ method is called when a connection is made, and that’s how you set WebSocket session parameters.</p>

<h3 id="label-2.+ActionCable+now+sends+a+-22welcome-22+message+to+the+Thor+task+-28your+CLI-29">2. ActionCable now sends a “welcome” message to the Thor task (your CLI)</h3>

<p>Rails sends you a message of type ‘welcome,’ which calls a callback in the thor worker code called “on_connected.”</p>

<h3 id="label-3.+Thor+task+sends+a+-22subscribe-22+message+to+ActionCable">3. Thor task sends a “subscribe” message to ActionCable</h3>

<p>The on_connected callback sends a subscribe message to ActionCable for the channel ‘WorkerChannel’ which is defined in app/channels/worker_channel.rb.</p>

<h3 id="label-4.+WorkerChannel+Starts+Stream+for+Client">4. WorkerChannel Starts Stream for Client</h3>

<p>The WorkerChannel’s subscribe method calls stream_for to client_#client_id.</p>

<p>This is the reference that the rest of the app will use to send messages to this client.</p>

<h3 id="label-5.+ActionCable+sends+a+-27confirm_subscription-27+message+to+Thor+task+-28your+CLI-29">5. ActionCable sends a ‘confirm_subscription’ message to Thor task (your CLI)</h3>

<p>Once the Thor task receives this confirmation (remember it is waiting in an async loop executing callbacks on each message received), it calls the ‘on_subscribed’ method on account of the message type (confirm_subscription).</p>

<h3 id="label-6.+Thor+task+hits+the+-2Fworkers-2Fstart+route+to+start+a+background+job">6. Thor task hits the /workers/start route to start a background job</h3>

<p>The on_subscribed callback hits the /workers/start route (defined with all routes in config/routes.rb) which is configured to route to the WorkersController’s start method. The task passes its client_id in the request parameters, which allows us to communicate back to the client since the WorkerChannel utilized its client ID to create a streaming channel.</p>

<h3 id="label-7.+Worker-27s+-27perform_async-27+called+by+the+WorkersController">7. Worker’s ‘perform_async’ called by the WorkersController</h3>

<p>Worker is a class defined in app/workers/worker.rb. This is a Sidekiq worker that really doesn’t do much but sleep and broadcast messages to the client.</p>

<h3 id="label-8.+The+End">8. The End</h3>

<p>The Thor task will receive various messages that the worker started, updated, etc which you can see in the Worker class (app/workers/worker.rb). Note the callbacks on the Thor task to see what draws the progress bar on the screen.</p>
